# üß† tiny-recursive-model - Enhance Your AI Experience

## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the **Tiny Recursive Model** project! This software provides an easy way to utilize the Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), an improvement over the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) developed by Sapient AI. Designed by Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, this application opens up new possibilities in artificial intelligence and deep learning.
